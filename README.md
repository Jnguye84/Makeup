Data Visualization of makeup brands and their products in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

Ouf of the vegan product selection within makeup brands, what is the most affordable makeup brand?

### Introduction

According to [Fortune Business Insights](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/vegan-cosmetics-market-106594), "The global vegan cosmetics market is projected to grow from $15.87 billion in 2021 to $24.79 billion in 2028 at a CAGR of 6.57% in forecast period, 2021-2028..." This statistic got me curious on how the average consumer would change their makeup preferences once companies started to shift more into the 'vegan' category. Using an API dataset, I wanted to create an interactive interface where the user would be able to see their favourite brand's vegan products and how they compare with other brands. 

### Further Questions 

To continue further on from this project, I'd like to analyze how user's spending habits will change when it comes to buying vegan makeup or makeup in general (i.e. which products seem to be selling better than others). The purpose of analyzing this would be assist cosmetic companies to see which makeup products they should be investing in and which should be left discontinued or neglected.
